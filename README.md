# Waste_Management
Waste management is a critical component of sustainable development. The process of classifying 
and sorting waste significantly impacts the efficiency of recycling and disposal. This project aims to 
leverage machine learning techniques to automate the classification of waste types using sensor 
data. A boosted random forest model was developed and fine-tuned, achieving high accuracy in 
classifying waste into predefined categories. The project also addressed key challenges such as class 
imbalance, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction, making the model 
suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios.
